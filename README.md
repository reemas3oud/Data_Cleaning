# Data_Cleaning
Make at least 4 plots showing different insights. You must clean and tidy your data. If your dataset does not require cleaning then you cannot use the dataset. Write an explanation of what insights are seen in each plot. You are not allowed to use any datasets used in the lecture. Be prepared to present your cleaning process and plots on Sunday during group presentations at 10 AM.
